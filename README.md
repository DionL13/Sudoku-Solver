# Sudoku-Solver

Created by Dion Lepair across the span of a uni semester as a personal project to become familiar with Python. Includes solving strategies from https://www.sudokuwiki.org/Sudoku.htm, with all basic strategies and one tough strategy (namely X-Wing) included. This solver solves most standard hard sudoku puzzles one might encounter (which are inputted value-by-value into the array at the beginning of the Solver Python file), however may not be able to solve more difficult puzzles which require more complex strategies. 

To run the code, download all python files into the same location and open in Jupyter Lab/Notebook, then run Solver after inputting sudoku board.
