# Sudoku-Solver

Created by Dion Lepair across the span of a uni semester as a personal project to become familiar with Python. Includes solving strategies from https://www.sudokuwiki.org/Sudoku.htm, with all basic strategies and one tough strategy (namely X-Wing) included. This solver solves the most standard hard sudoku puzzles one might encounter (which are inputted value-by-value into the array at the beginning of the Solver Python file), however may not be able to solve more difficult puzzles which require more complex strategies.
